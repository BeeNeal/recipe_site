## Why Django?
I am well-versed in Flask, and so wanted to see what Django has to offer.

## Why Vue?

At first I wasn't sure if using Vue.js was initially going to be overkill. I then decided that I can have pages with and without Vue - so not reason not to incorporate some Vue. Also, I will have features in my 2.0 and 3.0 versions that will benefit from fast data rendering, such as "Build Grocery List" feature.


## Other Tools Used:

Git + GitHub for version control
Visual Code Studio (my favorite Editor)
